## IDE Recommendations

To run Rust code, here are few IDE recommendations:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A lightweight yet powerful code editor with excellent Rust support through extensions like Rust Analyzer and Rust Language Server.

2. **IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust Plugin**: IntelliJ IDEA is a full-featured IDE that offers strong Rust support via the Rust plugin. It provides features like code completion, refactoring, and debugging.

3. **Atom**: A highly customizable text editor with a rich ecosystem of packages and extensions. You can enhance its Rust support with packages like `ide-rust` and `linter-rust`.

4. **Sublime T
