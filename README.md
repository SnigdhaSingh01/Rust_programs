Given a sorted array of integers, implement a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of a given number.
3.Shortest Word()
Given a string of words, implement a function that returns the shortest word in the string.
4.Prime/Non prime Checker()
Implement a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not.
5.Median of an array()
Given a sorted array of integers, implement a function that returns the median of the array.
6.Longest CommonPrefix()
Implement a function that finds the longest common prefix of a given set of strings.
